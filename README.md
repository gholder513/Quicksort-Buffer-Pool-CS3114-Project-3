# Quicksort-Buffer-Pool-CS3114-Project-3
Project for class developed in java. Given thousands of byte arrays, we need to sort them based on ByteBuffer getShort value. Uses Quicksort recursive algorithm and a buffer pool as an intermediary. My buffer pool implementation chooses to use a linkedList instead of an array. By the end of the program, all bytes in input file should be sorted.
